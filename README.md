# Spam-Classification
# 📧 Spam Classification using Machine Learning

This project is a simple spam detection system built using Python and machine learning, developed and tested in Google Colab. It classifies messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning models.

## 🚀 Features

- Text pre-processing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Classification using Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## 📁 Dataset

Used the popular **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, which contains 5,574 English messages labeled as spam or ham.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- NLTK (for text processing)

## 📊 Model Performance

Achieved over **95% accuracy** on the test set with a simple Naive Bayes classifier.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset or mount your Google Drive
3. Run all cells to train and test the model
